## Important
Please, read the requirements.txt file, as it is fundamental for the function of the program

## Functionality
Our application has a simple graphic interface in which we gather information that the user wants, using widgets from the tkinter module, after that you'll be able to see the results that match with the information taken as input, you can also use the back buttons to get to the main menu or to insert other values to get different recommendations.

The steps needed for the program to work once it runs are very trivial and self-explainatory, so everyone should be able to use it pretty easily.
