## Important
Please, read the requirements.txt file, as it is fundamental for the function of the program

## Calculations
Our algorithm takes the genre entry as the most important one, next, the difficulty (In a range of 3, if its the same it will take high value, if is different by 1 a medium value and different by 2 a low value) and finally the platforms. Also, if the user writes a developer that is in the database, those games will take a very high priority

## Functional requirements

- The system calculates the most similar game for the user depending on their inputs

- The management of data is done using a GraphQL database that is fetched when the app is initialized

- Users can navigate through the interface using buttons

- The technology used for this was Python programming language, as well as JavaScript and GraphQL for the building of the project

## Non Functional requirements

- Users must be connected to the internet for the app to get connected to the database

- The response time once the app is working should be short

- Graphic interface must be easy to understand and navigate through

- No legal requirements are needed since we do not sell anything

- Speed of opening could be long since the connection and fetchhing of the database should occur before the app works
