## Functional Requirement

The main use of a functional requirement right now is the use of the graphic interface, since we do not have our database complete, the management of data is not defined yet, so the main functional part of the program, which is classifying the information to give a result of games to the user is not developed yet.

As for the functionality of the graphic interface, we have a main menu with a button, which has the function of leading you to an input menu, were you can find a bunch of checkboxes for the genre and platforms, as well as the button to advance to the results, which will gather the information the user selected and assign it to the variables later to be used by the classes defined in the skeleton.

Note: We're still lacking the implementation of the widgets for the inputs of the developer and the difficulty.

Also, if you run the graphic inteface and it shows an error or doesn't show the main image, it might be because the path to the image file throws an error. In that case, please notify that through the GitHub issues.
